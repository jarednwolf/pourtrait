## Technical Implementation

### Data Source Hierarchy

1. **External Wine Database Data** (90-95% confidence)
   ```typescript
   wine.externalData.agingPotential // From wine APIs
   ```

2. **Expert-Curated Data** (70-95% confidence)
   ```typescript
   // Specific producer data
   {
     producer: 'ChÃ¢teau Margaux',
     region: 'Margaux',
     drinkingWindow: { earliest: 8, peakStart: 15, peakEnd: 35, latest: 50 },
     source: 'Wine Spectator',
     confidence: 0.95
   }
   ```

3. **Regional Patterns** (75-90% confidence)
   ```typescript
   'Bordeaux': { 
     baseAging: 12, 
     peakRatio: { start: 0.4, end: 0.8 }, 
     confidence: 0.9 
   }
   ```

4. **Varietal Characteristics** (70-80% confidence)
   ```typescript
   'Cabernet Sauvignon': { 
     baseAging: 10, 
     peakRatio: { start: 0.3, end: 0.7 }, 
     confidence: 0.8 
   }
   ```

5. **Algorithmic Calculation** (60% confidence)
   - Rule-based system for unknown wines
   - Based on wine type, region, vintage
